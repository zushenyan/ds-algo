# DFS

Mostyly used in

- count connected components (a graph is split into multiple parts)
- determine connectivity
- find bridge/articulation points

The time complexity is `O(Vertices + Edges)`

# BFS

Mostly used in

- shortest path on unweighted graphs.

The time complexity is `O(Vertices + Edges)`
